1. (context.js) this children that we passed as a prop are the all components inside AppContext in App.js
2. In (context.js) we'll write all logic of our application ex- cart logic like set items in cart or update items in cart. It means we'll put all global states logic that we need in multiple places we'll write in context.js and will use those in different other components. 
3. (Header.scss) First 3 0's inside rgba represents black color and 0.1 reprensents opacity magnitude
4. (Header.scss) as our icons are actually of type svg , so to style them we use svg
5. We are putting voilet color bubble inside which we have a number for telling number of items in the cart, we style bubble such that it comes in right top of the cart icon corner
6. So all the css we have written without media query will be our for mobile and media query md is used for specific desktop screens.
7. useEffect is called only once when the component is rendered. Depends on the dependency or the second argument of the useEffect

///// Making our header stickey
 In Header.jsx
 8.It means our even would be scroll and on scrolling we want handleScroll method to run.
 9. We want our header to get stickey after some point, so we want that as our scroll amount i.e. offset goes over 200px height then we want our header should be stickey. So for that we do "setScrolled" state to be true, else "setScrolled" state remains false.
 10. so by using our state, whenever our "scrolled" state is true we add our 'stickey-header' class, else false then do nothing 
 11. In (Header.scss) we do styling for "sticky-header" class, by setting 'postion' as sticky from top. And also we take use of animation to transform the header section while scrolling for doing this we make use of @keyframes .
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
////// Banner section starts
In (Banner.scss)
12.   height: calc(100vh - 80px); -> As 80px is our header height. So from 100vh for banner section we need to subtract 80px of height , so that we get the correct view height . Otherwise the banner section will extend a little bit down.
13. justify-content: flex-end; ->  if we want our banner img should align at rightmost side, so we need to do flex-end, cz by deafault it is flex-start so it would push img to the left side.
14. margin: 0 auto; ->  Margin from top and bottom will be 0 and auto-> left and right space will get equaly distriubute
15. flex-direction: column-reverse; -> As here we are dealing with mobile so we know data must be in column. In HTML 1st we have div for paragraphs then we have div for img . But we want that without changing HTML lets 1st include image then paragraph , So for doing that we make use of reverse property i.e. 'column-reverse'.
